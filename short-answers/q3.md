# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation is helpful because it simplifies code by making it easier to read. Instead of attaching an event listener to every single element that require the same handling, you can attach the listener to a parent element where the events for all the descendents will be handled. It is also helpful elements that are added dynamically, if it falls under a parent element that has an event delegated to it, the event handler will automatically apply to that new element.
